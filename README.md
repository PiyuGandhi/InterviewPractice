## Interview Practice

These are some interview questions on Geeks For Geeks Practice and Interview Bit donee by me entirely on Python.

Each file contains the problem statement and the solution to it.

I've also tried to make my code more object oriented and every solution is a class by the name of *Solution*

The basic template goes as:-

<code>

    '''
    Problem statement given
    '''


    class Solution:    
        # Code for it
    

    # Input interaction with testcases, etc.
</code>
