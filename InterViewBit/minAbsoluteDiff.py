'''
Given an array of n distinct integers. 
The problem is to find the sum of minimum absolute difference 
of each array element. 
For an element x present at index i in the array 
its minimum absolute difference is calculated as:
Min absolute difference (x) = min(abs(x â€“ arr[j])),
 where 1 <= j <= n and j != i and abs is the absolute value.
Input Constraint: 2 <= n Examples:

Input : arr = {4, 1, 5}
Output : 5
Sum of absolute differences is |4-5| + |1-4| + |5-4|

Input : arr = {5, 10, 1, 4, 8, 7}
Output : 9

Input : {12, 10, 15, 22, 21, 20, 1, 8, 9}
Output : 18
