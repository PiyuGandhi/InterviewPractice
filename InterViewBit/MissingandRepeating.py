'''
Given an unsorted array of size n. 
Array elements are in range from 1 to n. 
One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and 
one number occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Examples:

  arr[] = {3, 1, 3}
  Output: 2, 3   // 2 is missing and 3 occurs twice 

  arr[] = {4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1}
  Output: 1, 5  // 5 is missing and 1 occurs twice
